## Exit frequencies. 
- Doesnt seem to work in the neutral exciton system in my fyp report.
- Cant get any direct cascades, except for 4_5 to work.

## Indirect cascades.
- Seems to be most promising.
- Is a new point not made in existing literature.
- I am unsure as to whether we can extract data from the indirect curves.
- Perhaps something for Andreas to think about next week.

## Eigenvalue fittings.
- I am pessimistic about using these.

## Current plan.
Use this fitting method to decide whether cascades are D/I/A. Then use these results to back up the theory of GJ of the hot trion system. Simply re-write the section by GJ in the formalism of the master equation, the advantages of this is essentially we are building the model backwards, from the data first, which is a more purely scientific approach. We accept the fact that we are not able to fit parameters, we either state the fact or not.

## Things to think about.
Extracting parameters from the indirect transitions.
