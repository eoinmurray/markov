## Exit frequencies. 
- Doesnt seem to work in the neutral exciton system in my fyp report.
- Cant get any direct cascades, except for 4_5 to work.

## Indirect cascades.
- Seems to be most promising.
- Is a new point not made in existing literature.
- I am unsure as to whether we can extract data from the indirect curves.

## Eigenvalue fittings.
- I am pessimistic about using these.

## Current plan.
Use this fitting method to decide whether cascades are D/I/A. Then use these results to back up the theory of GJ of the hot trion system. Simply re-write the section by GJ in the formalism of the master equation, the advantages of this is essentially we are building the model backwards, from the data first, which is a more purely scientific approach. We accept the fact that we are not able to fit parameters, we either state the fact or not.

## Things to think about.

Extracting parameters from the indirect transitions.

# Paper

## Motivation

Many peaks QDs exhibit entanglement. This spectrum is systematic eacross the sample. We now carefully examine one QD, and do a wide range of measurements on it. We carefully define a formalism for examining the correlation curves. 
We apply this formalism to the data, which then allows to build a master equation model of the states in the QD fine structure.

## Master equation formalism.

Deriving g2. Observing the 3 different kinds of g2 exist. Direct, Indirect, Antidirect.

Indirect: after photon 1, in state x. need state y for photon 2.
if the probability of going from x->y is greater than the equil prob of being in y, then the (_cascade_) would be indirect.

## Adaptation of the model to the experimental conditions.

Measurement time - sigma. 
Nice convulted g2 function to fit and for parameter extraction. 

focus on this --> (
    four types of curves pre-conv - Direct, antidirect, fast indirect, slow indirect.

    three types of curves post-conv - Direct, antidirect, indirect because fast indirect is indistinguishable from direct.
) 

## experimental data.

show the spectrum, the lifetimes and the corr curves. Fit g2 to the corr curves. 
Talk about choosing which i D/A/I or whether is ambigious between D/I.

## building the charged biexciton fine structure model

Building on the characterisation of the curves in the previous section and introduction assumptions about the QD system (like 4-5 being XX-X, with FSS, power dep etc).
From this build up model of fine structure of the XX+ QD.
